# [Project 1: Analysis On Google Play Store: Project Overview](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Gathered data from the net and performed data cleaning to improve the data.
* Different libraries were used to perform the data visualization and outlier detection of the dataset.
* Machine Learning techniques like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression were used to predict the rating of the application.
*	Model with the highest accuracy was Logistics Regression with 77% accuracy.



# [Project 2: Hourly Energy Consumption](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
*	Used different cleaning techniques and made the data suitable for Exploratory Data Analysis. 
* Applied basic Python scripts for data cleansing, normalization, and outlier detection.
*	Checks for seasonality and trend were performed on the data.
*	Basic forecasting techniques to advanced forecasting techniques like ARIMA and XGBoost were used to determine the best model.



# [Project 3: Analysis On Used Cars](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Removed Null values from the dataset to make the dataset more usable.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to check the outliers and remove unwanted data.
* Different visualization techniques were used using matplotlib and seaborn.
* Different Regression Alogorithms as well as SVM and cross validation alogrithms were used to determine the accuracy of model of dataset.

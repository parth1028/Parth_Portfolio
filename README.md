# [Project 1: Analysis On Google Play Store](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Gathered data from the net and performed data cleaning to improve the data.
* Different libraries were used to perform the data visualization and outlier detection of the dataset.
* Machine Learning techniques like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression were used to predict the rating of the application.
*	Model with the highest accuracy was Logistics Regression with 77% accuracy.



# [Project 2: Hourly Energy Consumption](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
*	Used different cleaning techniques and made the data suitable for Exploratory Data Analysis. 
* Applied basic Python scripts for data cleansing, normalization, and outlier detection.
*	Checks for seasonality and trend were performed on the data.
*	Basic forecasting techniques to advanced forecasting techniques like ARIMA and XGBoost were used to determine the best model.



# [Project 3: Analysis On Used Cars](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Removed Null values from the dataset to make the dataset more usable.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to check the outliers and remove unwanted data.
* Different visualization techniques were used using matplotlib and seaborn.
* Different Regression Alogorithms as well as SVM and cross validation alogrithms were used to determine the accuracy of model of dataset.


# [Project 4: Analysis On Fifa 19](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Applied all the steps like data cleaning and checked for null values in dataset.
* Used seaborn and matplotlib for visulaization.
* Many diiferent findings were achieved from the dataset as wether wage decreases or increases due to some variable.
* Checked the Relationship between two different variables and what are the impacts on the data.

# [Project 5: Bank Maven Data](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Used Tableau for analysing the data, used modelling technique to improve the data and the aim was to find the customer performance from the dataset.
* Performed various calculations and filtering on the data to find the accurate values for easy understanding.
* All the findings were collectively displayed on the dashboard for better understanding.


# [Project 6: Visulaization Of COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/parth1028/Projects)
* Used different graphs to understand the data.
* Exact no of cases confirmed and how many people died were found with the help of these data.
* Used the map function for detailed information.
